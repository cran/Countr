Version 3.4.1

- bugs fixed in convolution methods

- option added to rescale covariates (standardise, standardise_scale).

- new vignettes added + many examples with different datasets fitted.

- Bibtex entries for citation of the vignettes added to REFERENCES.bib.

- numerous small improvements throughout the package.


Version 3.3.1

- new type = "prob" for residuals - changes in residuals.renewal,
     .objectiveFunction and renewal(). Comments and asome examples are
     temporarily put in the documentation of renewal().

- new argument 'log' for .objectiveFunction(). It is now passed on to probability
  computing functions to specify whether logged values are required when 'summa =
  FALSE'.



Version 3.3.0

- first changes on bitbucket

Version 3.2.8

- the call in the printout of renewal objects (and summary()) could be very wide
  (annoying in Sweave output), now print.renewal() and print.summary.renewal()
  obey 'width' when possible (see helper function .deparseCall()).

- bugs corrected in print.summary.renewal() when failure to compute
  variance or residuals

Version 3.2.7
- fixed some bugs in printing methods
- added a jss_paper vignette

Version 3.2.4
- merged changes done separately by T. and G. to Version 3.2.2
- fixed some bugs introduced in 3.2.3

Version 3.2.3
- all count functions vectorized in c++
- likelihood functions improved

version 3.2.2
- minor bug fixed in .checkInitialValues in the anc parameters
- all bivariate functionalities removed.
- fertility dataset now exported with data()

version 3.2.1
- minor bugs fixed in .objectiveFunction and predict with std.error
- last location/... vectorial parameters returned
- sign in the Frank Copula package changed to be more consistent with
the intuitive results: theta <0 -> negative dependence.

version 3.2.0
- consolidated the documentation
- to be first CRAN version


version 3.1.x
- clean-up for CRAN submission


version 3.0.0
- renewal constructor + formula + methods
- dePril convolution added
- changed the way built in distributions are called.


version 2.0.3
- inclusion of covariates using formula.
- Burr (weibull-gamma) distribution added
- delayed first arrival included.

version 2.0.1
- dePril convolution option added.

version 2.0.0
- headers files added taking advantage of Rcpp attributes.

- conv_utils.cpp added (contains the convolution general methods).

- weibull, gamma, gengamma counting processes added.

- option to add user based inter-arrival times distribution using
routines getProbs_directConv, getProbs_minConv; see tests for examples.


version 1.1.9
- incorporated the convolution computations from Tarak's paper.


version 1.1.8
- introduced file .Rbuildignore in the root directory of the package.

- shortened the name of subdirectory `Euler-van ...' to remove the complaint
  from `R CMD build' about long paths. Also, to remove the warning by 'R CMD
  check' about `not fully portable file names, replaced space with undescore in
  the directory name and the pdf file in it.

- in file `DESCRIPTION' - moved Rcpp from DEPENDS to IMPORTS:

- completed the roxigen argument descriptions (in the sense that `R CMD check'
  doesn't complain).


version 1.1.7
- gam_weiH and gam_weiA renamed ccX and ccY

- vectorial version dWeibullInterArrivalCountInd and
dWeibullInterArrivalCountFrankCopula improved

- vectorial version with gamma heterogeinity added: Note that you only
pass X %*% beta and not the exponential

- tests added based on Examples from McShane(2008) Paper

- tests added for bivariate vectorial functions

- cRes object removed from R/ to free some space

version 1.1.5

- pkg renamed from BivCount to Countr

- alphagen2 changed to alphagen

- oldCpp file removed

- gamma-heterogeneity functions added to the origanal and fast version

- covariates-heterogeneity functions added to the origanal and fast version

version 1.1.0

- renamed alphagen to alphagenOrig


- the signatures of the cpp functions now have namespace prefixes for namespaces
  other than Rcpp. In this way RcppExports.cpp does not need 'using namespace
  arma' which is not included by cRcpp::compileAttributes and devtools::test()
  and so needed to ber added manually after these calls.

  I actually used search and replace to replace occurences in the body of the
  functions in our cpp files, but since we can put the 'using namespace'
  directives in them, only the signatures of exported functions are important
  for the abovde purpose.


- replaced std::cout with calls to Rprintf() in C++ code, since direct printing
  from C++ inside R can cause problems (and is caught by R CMD check).
  Also removed <iostream.
